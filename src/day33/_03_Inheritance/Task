Task:

1. Define a class named `Employee` with the following fields: `name`, `baseSalary` (double), `salaryMultiplier` (int).
2. Create a constructor for the `Employee` class and add a method named `calculateSalary()`
   that returns the calculated salary as `baseSalary * salaryMultiplier`.
3. Add a `toString()` method to the `Employee` class.
4. Create a class named `GeneralManager` that extends `Employee` and adds an extra field `compensation` (double).
5. In the `GeneralManager` class, override the `calculateSalary()` method to include the `compensation` in the salary calculation.
6. Create a main class named `CompanyMain`. In this class, define an instance of an `Employee` and
   an instance of a `GeneralManager`. Calculate their salaries and print the payroll.

Methods:

For `Employee`:

public double calculateSalary() {
    return baseSalary * salaryMultiplier;
}

For `GeneralManager`:

public double calculateSalary() {
    return baseSalary * salaryMultiplier + compensation;
}
