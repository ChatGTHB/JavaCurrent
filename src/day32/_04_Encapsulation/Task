1. Define a class named `Car` with the fields: `model`, `brand`, and `price`.
2. Create a constructor in the `Car` class that initializes the `model`, `brand`, and `price` fields.
3. Apply encapsulation by creating getters and setters for all fields in the `Car` class.
4. Define a class named `CarDealership` with the following fields:
   - `dealershipName` (String)
   - `maxCarCapacity` (int)
   - `cars` (ArrayList<Car>)
5. Create a class named `ArabamCom` that contains the `main` method.
6. In the `ArabamCom` class, create an instance of the `CarDealership` class.
   Then, prompt the user to add cars to the dealership until the maximum capacity is reached.
   Ensure that no car with a model year older than 2000 is added.
   If a car with a model year older than 2000 is entered, ask the user to enter a different car.
