Task:
Create a Car Object

1. Define a `Car` class** with the following fields:
   - `color` (String)
   - `modelYear` (int) – the year of production
   - `engineCapacity` (int) – possible values: 1000, 1400, 1900, 2000, 6000
   - `numberOfDoors` (int)

2. Implement getter and setter methods for each field, ensuring that the object adheres to
   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, particularly encapsulation.

3. In the `main` method:
   - Create an instance of the `Car` class.
   - Set the values of the fields using the setter methods.
   - Retrieve and print the values using the getter methods to verify that
     the object has been correctly initialized and the values are properly stored.
