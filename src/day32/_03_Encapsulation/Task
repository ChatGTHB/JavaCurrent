Task:

1. Define a class named `Student` with the fields: `name`, `surname`, and `age`.
2. Create a constructor in the `Student` class that initializes the `name`, `surname`, and `age` fields.
3. Apply encapsulation by creating getters and setters for all fields in the `Student` class.
4. Define a class named `School` with the following fields:
   - `schoolName` (String)
   - `capacity` (int)
   - `students` (ArrayList<Student>)
5. Create a class named `SchoolMain` that contains the `main` method.
6. In the `SchoolMain` class, create an instance of the `School` class.
   Then, prompt the user to add students to the school until the maximum capacity is reached.
   Ensure that no student older than 15 is added to the school. If a student older than 15 is entered,
   ask the user to enter a different student.
7. Assign a unique ID to each student added to the school.
