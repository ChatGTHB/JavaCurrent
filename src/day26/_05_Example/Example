/*
    Step 1: Define a class named Customer with a field: name.
    Step 2: Define a class named ElectricityAccount with fields: totalConsumption (int), unitPrice (double).
    Step 3: Add an ElectricityAccount to the Customer.
    Step 4: Create one customer.
    Step 5: Write a method to accumulate the energy consumed by the customer each month.
             Let it be named addConsumption, which will accumulate each monthly value given.
    Step 6: Calculate the amount to be paid by multiplying the total consumption by the unit price (20) and print the bill.

    Hint: After creating the account, add 2-3 months of consumption using the addConsumption method,
          then calculate the total and print the bill.
