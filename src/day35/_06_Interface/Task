Task:

1. Create a `Shape` interface (or an abstract class) that includes the common methods `perimeter()` and `area()`.
2. Implement the `Shape` interface in both `Square` and `Rectangle` classes.
3. In the `main` method, create two objects (one for `Square` and one for `Rectangle`),
   assign values to them, and print their perimeter and area.
