Task:

1. Create a class named `Student` with the fields: `firstName`, `lastName`, `role`, and `classSection` (String).
2. Create a class named `Employee` with the fields: `firstName`, `lastName`, `role`, and `department` (String).
3. Write a single method that generates an ID card (output) for the objects of both classes created from the above.
   This method should be able to work with both classes.

Hint: For both the `Student` and `Employee` classes to use the same method, what should happen?

Example:

public void printID(Kisi person) {
    // print the ID for both Employee and Student
}

Both `Employee` and `Student` should extend a base class `Kisi` to work with the same method:
- `printID(Employee employee)`
- `printID(Student student)`
