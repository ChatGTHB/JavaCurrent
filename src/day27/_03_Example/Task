Task:

- At a university, students will be registering for courses.
1. `Lesson`: Fields: `name`, `hours` (values between 1 and 10).
2. `Student`: Fields: `name`, `maxHours`, and a list called `lessons`
   to keep track of the courses the student is enrolled in.
3. Create 3 lessons.
4. Define 1 student who can take a maximum of 10 hours (`maxHours`).
5. Add the available lessons to this student's lesson list. While adding lessons,
   ensure that the maximum allowed hours are not exceeded. If exceeded,
   show a warning like "Maximum allowed hours exceeded."
6. Add a method to print out 2 rules of the university at the beginning.

Example lessons:
- `Java101` 3 hours
- `Alg101` 5 hours
- `Math101` 6 hours

Your student can take a maximum of 10 hours,
so ensure this rule is followed when adding courses.
