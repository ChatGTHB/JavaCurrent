Difference and Purpose of Static and Non-Static Methods

Static Methods:
1. Declaration: Static methods are declared with the `static` keyword.
2. Purpose: They are used to perform operations that are general
   and independent of specific objects.
   Static methods can be called without creating an instance of the class.
3. Usage: Since these methods belong to the class itself (not to specific objects),
   they can be directly accessed using the class name.
4. Examples: Examples of static methods in Java include
   `Math.random()` and `Integer.parseInt()`.

Non-Static Methods:
1. Object-Specific: Non-static methods operate on individual objects
   and are specific to the instance they are called on.
2. Instance Dependency: Since they work with the data of a particular object,
   you must create an instance of the class (using `new`) and
   call these methods through the instance variable.

Summary:
- Static Methods: Useful for tasks that do not depend on object-specific data,
  allowing them to be called using the class name without needing an instance.
- Non-Static Methods: Designed for operations that require access to the instance
  variables of a particular object, necessitating the creation of an object instance to use them.
