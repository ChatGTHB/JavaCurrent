Task: User Authorization Module

1. Define a `User` class** with the following attributes:
   - `username`
   - `role` (values: `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `SALES`, `STAFF`)
   - `status` (values: `ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE`)

2. Create three users** with different roles and statuses, including one user with the `ADMIN` role.

3. Implement a function named `deleteUser` that:
   - Accepts a `User` object as a parameter.
   - Checks the user's role.
   - Displays a message indicating that the `ADMIN` user cannot be deleted.

4. Test the function** by passing the created users to `deleteUser` and observing the output.
