Task:

1. Abstract Class Shape:
   - Create an abstract class named Shape that has a name field.
   - Add the following abstract methods:
     - area(): to calculate the area.
     - perimeter(): to calculate the perimeter.
   - Add the following concrete methods:
     - toString(): to return a string containing the shape's name, area, and perimeter.
     - getName(): to return the name of the shape.
     - draw(): to print the shape's name and that it has been drawn.

2. Rectangle and Circle Classes:
   - Create two classes called Rectangle and Circle that extend from the Shape class.
   - Implement the area() and perimeter() methods in both classes.

3. Main Class:
   - Create instances of Rectangle and Circle in the main method and
     test their functionality by printing their details using toString().

Clarifications:

- Concrete Method: A method with an implementation (body).
    Example:
    void draw() {
        // This is a concrete method
    }

- Abstract Method: A method without an implementation (no body).
    Example:
    abstract void draw(); // Method signature
